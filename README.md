# CryptoClustering
# M19 Crypto Clustering - Unsupervised learning 
-
In this challenge, I used unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Analysis
I performed the following analysis for this challenge
- Found the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
- Clustered Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
- Optimized Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Found the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
- Clustered Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
- Visualized and Compared the Results
